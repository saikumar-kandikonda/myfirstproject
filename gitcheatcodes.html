step1. download $git from $git-scm-com
step2. Open $gitbash applicaiton. BASH MEANS Bourne AGAIN shell. to check $git version :$git --version //dipslays version
step3. initially we have all the project files in a folder but to add them to $git we need to initialize them into $git folder.
step4. $git status //gives the status of the $git
step5. $git init // this command will add all the folders openend into $git folder. and we can see as a  MASTER branch
step6. after initialization we need to set a username and EMAIL to $git. to do it 
		$git config --global  user.name 'give username here'
		$git config --global  user.email 'give email here'
		NOTE: here when we give GLOBAL. name will be declared globally and no need to give it again. if we dont give global username will be assigned for this project.
step7. once username and email is set. it will forever if it is GLOBAL. next is 1.WORKING DIRECTORY 2. STAGING AREA 3.REPOSITORY
		1. WORKING DIR: after initializing the $git folder it is called working dir. all the files are copied to $git folder. whenever we are making changes in hte file $git will not know changes are made. to make $git know all the changes file need to be in staging area. i.e USING $git add . //adds all the files and folders into $git folder
		2. STAGING AREA: this is a place where it tracks all the files added to GIT folder and displays all the changes when we commit. i.e using $git commit -m 'message here' //-m is a flag
		3. REPO: once all the changes are made and committed. it holds all the files here. it is a local REPO. to add this to GITHUB we need to add a remote. 
step8. once local REPO is created now we need to upload to GITHUB.
		>create a new REPO/projectname in GITHUB
		> $git remote //displays whether we already had a remote or not. if there are no remotes add by
		>$git remote add "https://github.com/saikumar-kandikonda/myfirstproject.git"  //it adds the link to the remote link. here whenever we are calling it we need to give the complete link. instead of that we can create a alias to the link so that we can with the alias name. below is the code
		>$git remote add origin "https://github.com/saikumar-kandikonda/myfirstproject.git"  //here origin is the alias name we can any name but generally it will be origin.
		>now in git remote we will have ORIGIN name
Step9.  after adding the remote now we need to push that to online
		>$git push -u origin master



$git log //it displays all the committed messages and every commit has a 40 hexadecimal id also called as GITID
$git log --oneline  //gives simple code
$MKDIR //makes a new folder
$touch FILENAME  //creates a new file
$git branch BRANCHNAME //used to create branch
$git checkout BRANCHNAME //used to shift b/w branches
$dir //displays all the files availble in the folder
$cat FILENAME //opens the file
$ git remote remove "remotenamehere" //removes the remote


TO MERGE BRANCHES TO MASTER

$git merge BRANCHNAME //whatever present in hte branch it will rplace all the content in the master

what is GITCLONE? >$git clone "give the link here" //we can use remote repo as localrepo

GITIGNORE >$git .gitignore //when we dont want to show some files we can use this option so that those files cant be seen 


HOW TO HOST IN GITHUB FOR FREE //
step1: create new repo with yourwebsitename.github.io and github.io is mand
step2:download github for windows and sign in with your github account.
step3: select clone a repo from the internet option and then give the name which you hvae given in step1.
step4: select "view the files in your repo in explorer" option and copy all the files which you want to host.
step5: once after all the files are uploaded into github account. to check whether website is active or not.
goto settings: github pages:source should be master branch.
